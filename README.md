# teleskope

## Reasoning



## Getting Started

The easiset way to deploy teleskope is with helm:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:
cd 
kubectl create ns teleskope
helm install . --name  \
               --set namespace=
```

Deploying teleskope with `HelmRelease`:
```
---

```

## Continued Development

Basically a roadmap.

### Coming soon
