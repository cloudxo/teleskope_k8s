# teleskope

## Reasoning



## Getting Started

The easiset way to deploy flux-web is with helm:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:
cd 
kubectl create ns flux
helm install . --name  \
               --set namespace=
```

Deploying teleskope with `HelmRelease`:
```
---

```

## Continued Development

Basically a roadmap.

### Coming soon


### Maybe in the future, if people want it

### Probably in the future

- select and release multiple workloads
